# Overview

This library is a collection of React components based off the [MUI library](https://mui.com/)
which adapt to the current device. The main goals of this library are:

- Style components differently based on the device
  - The iOS styles are based off [iOS 26](https://developer.apple.com/design/resources)
- Use native components when feasible
  - For example the Select component uses the native device select on Android & iOS
- Provide a better desktop experience
  - For example the Select component doesn't block interaction with other page elements when opened on desktop

## Why?

With existing similar libraries like [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/) & [Konsta UI](https://konstaui.com/)
one might ask why another library? The answer is simple: variety is the spice of life 😎.
The main differences this library has are:

- It's based on the [MUI library](https://mui.com/)
- It uses native components when feasible
