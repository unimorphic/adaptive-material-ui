# Overview

## Introduction

This library is a collection of React components based off the [MUI library](https://mui.com/)
which adapt to the current device. The main goals of this library are:

- Style components differently based on the device
- Use native components when feasible
- Provide a good desktop experience

## Why?

With existing similar libraries like [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/) & [Konsta UI](https://konstaui.com/)
one might ask why another library? The answer is simple: variety is the spice of life 📎.

## Thanks

- Thanks to [MUI](https://mui.com/) for being born
- Thanks to [Konsta UI](https://konstaui.com/) for figuring out how to fake iOS Liquid Glass in CSS
- Thanks to [Rspress](https://rspress.dev/) for building the magic behind this documentation site
